prilosec,Not Effective,"The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux.

My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal."

Fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). The hard part is I can't seem to get off this stuff!! The withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. It scares me so much that I just start taking it again. I'm stuck!!

propecia,Not Effective,"Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose."

I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday.

I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person."

Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.

Previously used another brand but was discontinued by HMO.  Much depends on regular exercise & regular sleep activities to be effective."
neurontin,Not Effective,"BENRFITS OF TREATMENT: Unsure - My legs ache. I don't remember ever having any real pain, other than an annoying ache in both legs. I feel as though I am walking in wet fishing boots.  There is a buzzing in my legs and feet. It has over the past several years crept up from my ankles to above my knees. With all this I do very well walking a slow pace - sometimes like a drunken Sailor. I walk down 101 stairs  tale a short walk and come back up 2 at a time (slowly) holding onto a rail (now)."
lyrica,Not Effective,None!
elavil,Effective,restful sleep
aloprim,Effective,I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.
citalopram,Not Effective,I felt that i did not feel any benefits from this drug.
metrogel,Not Effective,Sometimes lessoned redness
wellbutrin-xl,Not Effective,"elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed."
chantix,Effective,Loss of the desire to smoke and eventually the cessation of smoking altogether.
prempro,Effective,daily hot flashes and night sweats are much less severe if any at all. sleep is less distrubed and mood swings are much less. i no longer feel enraged when i wake in the morning.  Depression is gone and i feel less tired (probably because i get more sleep).
provigil,Not Effective,none
mobic,Not Effective,"quite effective without the adverse effects of aspirin, naproxin etc.
because of the reported side effects of cox2  meds i take as little as possible to maintain a reletively comfortable exixtence"

I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion)."
retin-a,Not Effective,"I saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. I believe it exacerbated my acne. On the mornings after the nights I used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst)."
neurontin,Not Effective,"at the highest dosage, the generic, gabapentin, seemingly reduced nerve pain resulting from Peripheral Neuropathy following surgery to remove neuromas in both feet (although it is a very subjective pain, which is affected by other factors: tension, sitting for prolonged periods, etc.)"
lorazepam,Effective,"i could control my panic and knew i could. therefore, just having lorazepam with me was often enough. over the years, my attacks diminished, first in severity, then in quantity."
vivelle-dot,Effective,"The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication."
lexapro,Not Effective,My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.
relafen,Not Effective,"The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month."
yasmin,Effective,"I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody."
klonopin,Not Effective,None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.
tri-luma,Not Effective,"slight lightening of dark spots. there was really no benefit beyond this.  seems like a waste of time and in fact, just regularly applying sunscreen seems to do a better job of lightening the spots"
mirapex,Effective,"My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies."
vyvanse,Effective,Helps with concentration and staying focused. Helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent.

metronidazole,Effective,"Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries."
ambien,Effective,Is very helpful with insomnia.  Was able to put racing thoughts that run threw my mind at rest.  Was able to get into a deep sleep.
zoloft,Not Effective,"The drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the 10 11 months it didn't seem to work anymore."
depo-provera,Effective,"After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong."
doxycycline,Not Effective,So far so good. Will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. One area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. No inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before.
solodyn,Not Effective,"I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn."
suboxone,Effective,"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life."
effexor-xr,Not Effective,I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.
zmax,Effective,"This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage."

paxil-cr,Effective,"It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore."
ativan,Not Effective,"At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan."
ranitidine,Not Effective,"Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment."
amoxil,Not Effective,"I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours."
tamiflu,Effective,"'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course."

soltamox,Effective,A non return of breast cancer
celebrex,Effective,Reduction of pain and inflammation.
lyrica,Effective,good unless a stop for a few days
zyprexa,Not Effective,There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.
yasmin,Effective,pregnancy prevention

xyzal,Not Effective,My allergies were a little better.  My nose was not as runny.
effexor,Not Effective,"The drug prevented emotional highs and lows.  Specifically helped with crying too much.  Lessened the intense ""caring"".  In some cases, it lessened it too much."
cymbalta,Effective,"This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness."
imitrex,Effective,this drug will make a migriane sufferer inot a real believer in modern medicine--it really gets rid of the headache and allows you to live. I could not be more positive
voltaren,Effective,"Without the Voltarin, every step I take makes my joints feel like cracking glass and they ache constantly. This drug greatly reduces that pain throughout the entire day."
tetracycline,Effective,"The product took great care of my razor bumps.  If I applied it at night, I was clear by the morning.  I only stopped taking it as the condition itself lessened."
valtrex,Effective,"After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours."

climara,Effective,"My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches."
requip,Effective,"While standing, my legs were fine, but aching, cramping legs were keeping me from getting any sleep.  My doctor suggested I try Requip, and its been the best thing I have done."
percocet,Effective,relieved pain at first but quickly became tolerant and wouls wear off hours before the next dose was due
celexa,Effective,"The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it."
restasis,Effective,"Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when I resumed treatment."

remeron,Not Effective,No apparent benefits.  Had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use.
effexor,Not Effective,"the xanax has a calming effect, and takes the edge off the effexor side effects."
buprenorphine,Effective,"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication."
fiorinal,Not Effective,It assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief.
doxycycline,Not Effective,"I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me."
zomig,Effective,Elminated 95% of Migraines/Headaches!
climara,Not Effective,"nothing noticeable really, night sweats improved (slightly), memory, not as fuzzy"
ortho-tri-cyclen,Effective,"Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period."
synthroid,Not Effective,"The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later."

cytomel,Effective,"when the standard treatment for hypothyroid didn't work to raise my baseline t3 & t4 levels, i continued to experience all of the low thyroid symptomsA:  coldness, lethargic, depression, etc.  by taking cytomel on the 5 x daily basis, i have very close to normal functioning thyroid activity."

oxazepam,Effective,"I would get heart palpitations and major stress hours before my ex would come and pick up our daughter for visits; I also had difficulty sleeping if I had to deal with any issues with him; I would take one of these pills, only if I felt I needed and sometimes an hour before he would pick her up, and I would feel much calmer.  It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach."
prinivil,Not Effective,"My mother had slight high blood pressure and was prescribed Lisinopril along with the water pill. The medication was doing its job, lowering BP to normal."
atenolol,Effective,"the overall experience was positive, with little to no side effects, blood pressure medicine dropping blood pressure from 180/100 to 117/70 in 3 months.  lower blood pressure prevents heart disease and risk of stroke or other ailments associated with hypertension."

imitrex,Effective,"Once a day, sometimes 2 in a 24 hour period depending on the severe headache"
proscar,Not Effective,"I noticed hair regrowth in small amounts but did not know my genitals were shrinking.  A friend told me of his testicles shrinking on the drug and so I examined myself and realized that what once was, was no more."
triphasil,Effective,"General Medical:  The treatment is for contraception.  I used it for weight control, skin problems and as a contraception, it was very effective for all of it except that when i left the medication I experienced severe hair loss which i was not warned about"
cipro,Not Effective,none...I am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since I had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and I would be telling a bald faced lie if I said there were and but I will keep on typing so that I comply with the request for the fifty word minimun

prinivil,Effective,BP running normal - no seizure activity - cholesterol good

I enjoy  coffee, wine, hot spices, hot showers, really only limit sun exposure and the rosecea seems better. Also in the morning if I notice red spots it seems to help."
maxalt,Effective,"After about an hour, headaches disappear. This drug works better for me than other drugs taken before the year 2000, such as Imitrex and Zomig which I took for migraines. Imitrex sped up my heart which scared me. Zomig took 2 hours to work for me.
Maxalt changed my life as I finally am able to function instead of wasting a whole day in a dark room in tears from the pain of migraine. I do not miss work days anymore."
naproxen,Effective,"I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear."
antivert,Effective,Restored me from total incapacitation to a full function.

lunesta,Effective,"For years I was sleep deprived due to working conditions.  Rarely would I enjoy the luxury of a full night sleep. Typically I would take hours to get to sleep and had extreme difficulty remaining asleep. Dreams were too realistic and often I would be more tired in the morning than upon retiring to bed. Taking Lunesta has allowed me not only to get to sleep but return to sleep.  If I wake in the middle of the night, for example to go to the bathroom, I am awake and not stumbling. The vivid dreams are gone and I have experienced no groggy or hungover symptoms that you sometimes hear of when taking sleep medication. 
It has truly changed my life and I am so grateful for my Dr. for his prescription."
tambocor,Effective,prevented 90% of tachycardia incidents. when tachycardia did occur it was less dramatic
lipitor,Effective,"It lowered my cholesteral considerably.  My total cholesteral was over 300 and my LDLs were over 200, but after being on Lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now 186 and my LDL is 86, so I am in good shape.  In addition, I have experienced NO side effects whatsoever, so I am pleased.  The only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $40.00 per month."
ventolin-hfa,Not Effective,None
flonase,Not Effective,"I have rhinitis almost all year long. Usually it gets worse in the cold season. I have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don?t work for me at all.

sumatriptan,Effective,"got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. Imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.   There would be times, perhaps one out of three, where I would  consider taking two of the 50 mg sumatriptans"
percocet,Not Effective,"Pain is now under control to some degree.  Still have pain throughout body and down legs.  Before the medication I would not be able to get out of bed for sometimes days.

I have a better memory, concentration, and overall mood.  I have regained my creativity.  My appetite/desire to overeat has decreased, though I still have an appetite.  I just eat like a normal person, now.  I don't suffer from emotional or boredom eating.  I am steadily losing weight--8 lbs. so far.  I also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that I couldn't do before.  I feel like someone handed me my life back!"
clarithromycin,Not Effective,Immediately took the pain from the Strep away.
citalopram,Effective,"I sufffered from dibilatating panic attacks, but they only lasted 15-20 minutes max. I was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. It got to where I had an attack at least every other day. The Citalopram kicked in in about 2 weeks and I've had only 1 episode since, granted I've only been on it for 2 months but it has worked wonders for me."
prozac,Not Effective,"none, I felt worse. This is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact I felt much much worse. Unfortunately, I didn't review the contraindications."
valtrex,Not Effective,To lessen the severity of an onset or outbreak of genital herpes.
zoloft,Effective,"Highly motivated vs my previous state of, ""why do I get up in the morning""? Nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person."
chantix,Effective,WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist.
zyrtec,Effective,stopped sneezing runny nose and other allergic symptoms.effecive for common cold and fever if given in the begning of the disease.can be taken till the sputum changes the color to yellow.can be taken till transparent sputum or discharge from nose.result is very quick (within some hours after taking the tablet)
elidel,Not Effective,"It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues."
climara,Effective,"Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch."
lyrica,Not Effective,I feel alot less pain taking the Flexeril (only at night) and the Lyrica.
seroquel,Effective,"Seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression."
prevacid,Effective,Reduced acid production to normal levels.
proscar,Effective,"my urination problems (urgency , frequency , etc ) practically disappeared and I no longer had get off my bed to urinate several times during the night"
seroquel,Effective,"Initially I was prescribed it to knock me the hell out after 4 days of beautifully manic insomnia. Then after the mixed episode ended they spiked the dose over the course of a few months to 300, where it sits. 

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect."
danazol,Effective,"After a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. It was a few cm big. By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then."
celexa,Effective,"I'm only four days in, but I already feel more like myself than I have in a year and a half.  The effects were almost immediate.  I've taken more responsibility, had more energy, and been more outgoing already."
ditropan,Effective,The medicine has stopped her wetting both day and night and worked within a week of her taking it. She is over the moon and so am I!
mobic,Not Effective,Honestly I have felt no change in my symptoms. If anything it feels as if they are getting worse. I constantly am getting sever headaches and my symptoms have not alleviated. I have not experienced any type of symptoms. I am also extremly tense to where the tendons in my neck do no sit flat.
permapen,Not Effective,"Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.  Would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment."
synthroid,Not Effective,"Had to take a thyroid replacement, so it did that, but not as well as I would have expected."
tirosint,Not Effective,No improvement at all in symptoms.
prednisone,Effective,"This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up. Now, if I ever feel the itch or see the blotchiness I can take one dose of this medicine and the hives do not progress and they are clear within one day."
zegerid,Not Effective,Reduced symptoms of acid reflux
paxil,Effective,I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.
solodyn,Effective,"Solodyn virtually eliminated any acne I had, both on my face and body.  It took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication."
imitrex,Not Effective,"I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!"
allegra,Not Effective,"Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above."
flonase,Effective,"It cleared up my nasal allergies, my stuffy nose, post nasal drip and as an added benefit it also helped prevent getting hoarse."
remicade,Effective,Fistula is considerable reduced. Almost healed. Fluid developing in the fistula is also healed. Frequency of stool passing is also reduced to twice a day.
lyrica,Not Effective,None
phendimetrazine,Effective,A total of 20 pounds lost in one month.
azopt,Effective,"Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work."
armour-thyroid,Effective,"Not as tired, thicker hair, not gaining weight as easily"
ambien,Effective,"I had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. I was prescribed Ambien 10mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. On the nights I didn't take the medicine, I woke up all through the night. With the medicine, I slept well and soundly."
niaspan,Effective,"My total serum cholesterol dropped from 280 to 198, LDL dropped from 225 to 122, HDL increased from 38 to 57. My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches, and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes, urea, or sugar."
ditropan,Not Effective,The drug helped to decrease hyperhidrosis
adipex-p,Not Effective,I experienced a weight loss of approximately 3 kg in 1 month. The effects tapered off in the second month with the total weight loss to be estimated at 6 kg. Subsequently I felt less urge to snack
lyrica,Not Effective,There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.
zoloft,Not Effective,Patient experienced no treatment benefits.
azelex,Not Effective,I was not able to use the cream long enough because of the side effects.
selegiline,Effective,increased synaptic dopamine levels. This gave me an amazing sense of wellbeing and clarity.

wellbutrin,Effective,"Within a couple of weeks, intrusive thoughts of suicide abated.  Over the next few weeks mood lifted some.  At the time I started I was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  Didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  And I'm against anti-depressants as 1st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. Mood disorders."
wellbutrin,Effective,"Wellbutrin and Prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are."
remeron,Effective,"Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun."

adderall,Effective,"Definitely noticed right away that I had more energy, better concentration and motivation, and could actually focus for the first time in years. By taking this med, it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: I started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. Now the med simply acts as a support for me, but I am ready to start tapering down my dose!!!"

lo-ovral,Effective,"Within days, the acne disappeared. When taken continuously for 3-5 months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  We then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone."
lexapro,Not Effective,"I was experiencing a lot of hot flashes and I think they have subsided in frequency, duration and intensity since starting to take the Lexapro."
prempro,Effective,"I was prescribed Prempro by my OB/GYN for hot flashes. I took one pill a day for over a year. I wento off the Prempro for 3 months and the hot flashes came back, seemed worse than before.

paxil,Not Effective,there was none.
propecia,Effective,Hair loss all but stopped - kept crown area full.
zoloft,Effective,"instantly i felt relieved. i am able to stand back a bit from things that would previously really upset me. i am therefore able not to let things get to me,fantastic. so now i don't  explode instantly in anger at things anymore, i tried to think myself calm and non reactive previously but it did not work. with zoloft i have a calmness when meeting things that would normally make me enraged .i have time and mental space to be rational and realistic and can choose a sane quiet and dignified response, not aggression and anger. hallelujah."

wellbutrin,Not Effective,Did not take it long enough for any noticeable benefit.
klonopin,Effective,"The drug has a very long half life and because of that property there is a long, smooth sustained effect of the drug. I did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew I was taking it except it helped my anxiety."

I noticed colours for the first time in years and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful sky, grass and flowers. I felt alive, energetic, happy and positive, For the first time in years I wanted to get up in the mornings and LIVE. I wanted to go out in the world again, where as before I hid in my house because of panic attacks. I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done, I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later, at which time I had to discontinue, but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life."
relpax,Effective,migraine pain relieved in 1 - 2 hours and lasted for 24 hours with 1 tablet
avita,Effective,"After only three days of treatment my partner noticed a reduction in the hyperpigmentation, it took me about a month to notice these effects. Having used tretinoin now for two months the crepiness under my eyes is greatly reduced, there is undoubtedly a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and the hyperpigmentation is getting better every day."
oxycodone,Effective,"Oxycodone helped take the major edge off of pain so I could rest. However, it made me so drowsy and felt ""out of it"" that I would switch to Ibuprofen."
concerta,Not Effective,mildly increased attentiveness
ortho-tri-cyclen,Not Effective,"Prevented pregnancy, completely cleared up my (moderate) acne."
fioricet,Effective,treatment benefits include migrain pain subsiding in about 20 minutes.  No lingering fuzziness from taking this medication.  Did not make me sleepy.

remeron,Effective,Felt 'normal' rather than in a state of panic and anxiety. Thoughts were clearer and not racing. Felt calm and peaceful.
vyvanse,Effective,"After taking Adderall XR for about a year, my doctor switched me to Vyvanse.  Vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of ADHD that I was experiencing, but it does so for about 12 hours.  With Adderall XR, the effects lasted only a few hours, and I experienced a crash after the effects wore off and I instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  With Adderall XR, I also lost the desire to eat.  I am hungry with Vyvanse, and do have the desire to eat.  With Vyvanse, I do not feel the crash at the end of the day, and I do not experience any moodiness.  I am very please with this drug, and it has changed my life for the better.

crestor,Effective,much lower cholesterol
lipitor,Effective,lowered lipid levesl
botox,Effective,"Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details."
cymbalta,Effective,"Hello all !
Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription."
cipro,Not Effective,None. The Cipro appeared not to work for my skin infection.
lexapro,Not Effective,"The first few days I felt ""happier"""
tetracycline,Not Effective,"I do still see reduction in the papules but the redness is still there. In fact, I am wondering if I am developing an immunity because the redness seems to be worsening. Also my skin seems to be getting more sensitive n general."
albuterol,Effective,"I could breathe, and if I took it before exercise, I wouldn't need it during."
cialis,Effective,Very quck and long lasting erection. Have been able to have sexual intercorse for 2-3 days no problem. That also had a psychological effect of easing anxiety.

I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return."

tetracycline,Not Effective,"My rosacia and acne were improved 60% by the drug but I believe that the Murad Skin Care line for acne helped more than the drug.  I used both daily, first the drug for 3 mo. then the Murad for 3 mo.  The Murad appeared to help more without any negative side effects. My skin on the drug was very sensitive to sunlight but not with the Murad treatment."
trimethoprim,Effective,The drug was to prevent further infections which were starting to scar the kidneys. After taking the drug my daughter did not have any more infections. it was a low level dose and did not seem to affect her in any way e.g causing digestive problems.
keppra,Not Effective,"We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control."
zoloft,Not Effective,made my daughter less anxious
baraclude,Effective,"The viral load count was reduced from millions to less than a hundred within 9 months. Though the virus cannot be completely removed, reduction in number helped my physiological health in addition to the physical.

seroquel,Effective,"Seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams.

oracea,Effective,"Marked reduction in redness & flushing and complete elimination of pustules.  Ease of use over creams, etc."
lexapro,Not Effective,"The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases."
retin-a,Effective,"My acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to Retin-A!  It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began."
cipro,Effective,"I landed in a West African hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. I vomited for 12 hours until I got the drip and then I was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).

Cipro is also the god of beating Urinary tract infections: I've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly."
celebrex,Not Effective,I did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  I chose to discontinue the treatment.
minocycline,Effective,"Treatment cleared the complexion from acne breakout and eliminated the redness/residual under the skin.  This drug had an almost immediate effect on the facial and back areas of the patient.  If the patient stopped taking the minocycline, the acne almost immediately returned.  It kept the bacteria at bay while on the medication."
lunesta,Not Effective,Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it).
soma,Not Effective,None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.

fosamax,Not Effective,The bone mass in my spine improved.   One hip was stable and one had lower bone density
spironolactone,Effective,"The benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. I used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. I did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. However, I still breakout. Not with cysts but smaller pimples. They seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. I have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. Spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. My face is also less oily."

metformin,Effective,My blood sugar is under control. I went from an A1c of over 8.0 to an A1c of 5.3 over the course of treatment. This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable.
differin,Not Effective,"to be honest, I am uncertain yet. I believe it will take months to see results"
synthroid,Not Effective,"TSH went up to 51 when put on low dose of natural thyroid. Doing better on synthroid rather than generic brand.  Still have fatigue, memory, weight loss problems.  I believe there are things that the blood tests do not show. Not freezing anymore."

lexapro,Effective,After the first few DAYS my anxiety was greatly reduced. I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression.
propecia,Effective,"My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on."
metrogel,Not Effective,There were not any benefits.  Galderma changed metrogel and the new formula didn't agree with my skin.

in cases of severe nausea."

norvasc,Not Effective,"Fingers didn't turn white for as long or as often as they used to.  However, my fingers are still a shade of blue, and hands are still cold.  My face still changes colors throughout the day, from pale, to blue, to red.  It helped, but not enough.  The doctor has prescribed 30mg Nifedipine to see if that works better."
imitrex,Not Effective,"Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too."

lamisil,Effective,"Cured ingrown toenails, straighter growing nails, whiter, clearer nails."

axert,Effective,"This ia a life altering medication for me.  I get occaisional migraines due to hormonal changes, allergy and weather changes.  This medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  It works within about an hour.  It stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  I am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug."
propecia,Not Effective,"The benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). I noticed that less hairs in the M shape were falling out.

permapen,Effective,the pain in my tooth started to subside
seroquel,Effective,"The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning."
prinivil,Not Effective,It did lower my BP some

completely relieved acid reflux and eliminated all symptons such as heartburn, cough, etc.
completely relieved acid reflux and eliminated all symptons such as heartburn, cough, etc."
fosamax,Not Effective,"No benefits whatsoever, no change in bone density. I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself."
cialis,Effective,"full long lasting erection up to two days after 20mg dosage,plus it works when you are ready, i must say it brings you back to your youth."
mirtazapine,Not Effective,Helped me easily get a good sleep. Possible reduction in IBS symptoms.
avage,Not Effective,"I didn't notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. I wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. I didn't notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as I had hoped. I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles."
betamethasone,Not Effective,"After the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. A second injection was administered. There was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared."
renova,Effective,"Early this year I started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using Lancome eye cream.  Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic."
wellbutrin,Not Effective,"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water."

seroquel,Not Effective,None.

It made me feel like I was in my 30's again instead of my 50's.  It enables me to do yoga moves which I could not do because of the pain.  It's changed my life.  None of the side effects that narcotic pain relievers give.  No tiredness or spaciness

zyprexa,Effective,"my experience with zyprexa has been very positive. it really saved my life.
i am able to think very clearly now."
celexa,Effective,"Most say it takes 6 weeks for this drug to really be in your system. After taking for 3 days I could feel the effects, I was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back."

levoxyl,Effective,"My hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  Now it is growing back and getting thicker.

I have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!"

soma,Effective,"The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain , nearly completlly, and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use."
metronidazole,Not Effective,"Apparently prevented wound infection, though efficacy of drug is questionable and causality cannot be established."
prinivil,Effective,"Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours.

trazodone,Effective,sleep
xyrem,Effective,"For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me."

levaquin,Not Effective,Absolutely none
naproxen,Effective,"improved range of motion, pain relief and decreased soreness"

dispermox,Not Effective,"Amoxicillin did little, if any, good for the infection I had with my abcessed tooth. I also had a skin lesion caused by a bacteria, per the doctor, but Amoxicillin did not effect this at all. It stayed the same through the days I took this antibiotic."
elavil,Not Effective,"Took 25mg for insomnia for about 3 weeks. Did not notice a difference. The Doctor Prescribed 50mg, and still no difference.

paxil,Effective,I had several episodes of extremely high blood pressure 212/90 was one reading.  It was mainly a product of work related stress and being overweight.  First I was treated with Prozac for the depression/anxiety and became suicidal.  With the Paxil and Lisinopril combination my blood pressure is controlled and I do not suffer from depression nor anxiety.  I respond to outside stimuli in a more normal way.
lexapro,Not Effective,Absolutely none. This drug destroyed my marriage. I was so irrationally angry over really stupid stuff. I was raging at my husband for no reason. And it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. I have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. I would pull this drug from the market.
effexor-xr,Not Effective,My anger and depression seemed to get much better within 3 weeks of starting on 75 mg. My dose was eventually increased over time to 150mg.  My family noticed a difference in my attitude.
effexor,Effective,depression reduced - I had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - I suddenly felt a 100% better after  a week or so - I had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect.

I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.
catapres,Not Effective,"Catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. For this reason I began taking Betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). Taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.

A side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my Rosacea symptoms. I have had the reason for this explained to me, but cannot recal the details (has something to do with Catapres effect on the sympathetic nervous system)."
premarin-vaginal,Effective,"This dosage works in keeping bladder irritations almost completely non-existent.
Before beginning this treatment I had recurring bladder irritations that felt like a bladder infection.  When tested, there was never any bacteria present.

fosamax-plus-d,Effective,"Between 1998 and 2006, when I was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. After I received my bone density results in 2006, my physician put me on Fosamax, which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008, my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period.

I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose!"

It was several months ago that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2-I was immediately prescribed Lamictal-I didn't really notice a difference so my dr. upped it to 150mg. It has worked wonders! I am so proud to say that I am happy and I haven't felt this elation in years! I can actually stay awake during the day, I have the drive to exercise, my labido is back(sure did miss that), almost no mood swings at all and most importantly I feel like a mother again! I have 3 beautiful little girls that I can hug, kiss, and love again!! I feel like crying-in a good way-everytime I think about how happy I am! My only fear is wondering how long this will last-I can only pray this will last forever."
premarin,Effective,"After my hysterectomy, I was depressed, didn't want to have company, was suspicious of everyone and everything. I wasn't feeling like my former self at all.

I take Premarin (.625mg) daily."

botox,Effective,"I used to have near-daily migraines.  I tried every migraine medication on the market.  Either they didn't have any effect, or I was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, I am virtually migraine-free for months."
albuterol,Effective,Opened lungs when breathing was difficult.
enbrel,Effective,"My worst symptom was in my feet. It was painful to walk, and therefore I walked slowly even when I used shoes with good support (Birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. There was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. These were my symptoms when I was on methotrexate alone. When I started Enbrel, I felt the effects within hours. Within the same day I could walk decently with much less pain. Within the next few days and weeks, I'm practically back to normal. In my second month, I think I started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and I read about: I felt a faint shadow of the foot pains I used to experience but I can still move normally."
neurontin,Effective,"The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile!"
sarafem,Effective,"I have taken this drug off and on for the past 13 years. I have always had good results with it, but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then, after my last child, I tried to make it without medication, but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However, I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner."
levoxyl,Not Effective,"I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels. It's kind of strange, as they've only were back in range, when i stopped taking l-thyroxine."

sarafem,Effective,"This drug improved my mood greatly. I can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs.

Now each month I do not suffer from cramps and am very happy."
accutane,Effective,"Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days.

After taking the drug for the 12 weeks, the physician recommended another 12 week course, however my insurance company would not cover the extended treatment and I could not afford the cost of Lamisil. Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment"

I litlerally have NO PAIN whatsoever in my knees..."
ambien,Effective,"The Ambien did give me a solid nights rest. I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about, i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect."

keflex,Not Effective,"Mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox.

I thought I was going to suffer for weeks. It was so painful and kept scabbing then the scabs would fall off after drinking or taking a shower. Then I saw my dr who prescribed Zovirax ointment.

Ever."

metrogel,Not Effective,Reduced redness of the forhead and cheeks.

estrasorb,Effective,"completely changed my way of life...  within days, could tell a difference... no longer suffer from night sweats or hot flashes at all,  the best thing i have ever tried..  this is a topical lotion that comes in individual packets that are 1.74 grams each (daily dosage is  2 packets)"

I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero."
nexium,Effective,"I had suffered from daily acid reflux for approximately 4 or 5 months. Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs, including ranitidine, Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped. Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet."

acyclovir,Effective,"It is very effective, especially if you take it early enough. But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times. The sad thing is, I'm only allowed 4 refills a year, so I have to lower my dosage, but, it still works."

evoclin,Not Effective,The acne cleared up but the evoclin was used in combination with proactiv.  Proactiv was used before and then started getting acne again.

byetta,Effective,this drug kept my sugar down constantly to where it should be finally.i am very satisfied with it so far.
retin-a-micro,Effective,"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience."
panixine-disperdose,Effective,"My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.  I continued to heal faster than I think I would have without the medication."
ultracet,Effective,I WAS LIVING WITH PAIN IN MOST OF THE MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS OF MY BODY.  IT HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF HAVING TO HAVE HELP TO GET OUT OF BED.  WHEN THERE WAS A FLARE-UP I HAD TO GO TO BED. TRAMADOL HCL COMBINED WITH CYMBALATA REDUCED MY PAIN BY ABOUT 85%!  MADE MY LIFE LIVABLE AGAIN.  I'M THANKFUL THAT I HUNG IN THROUGH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CYMBALATA.  IT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND I'M THANKFUL THAT FINALLY DID.

advair-hfa,Not Effective,"improved breathing, less frequent asthma attacks and the ability to run either outside or inside, depending on the season"
levoxyl,Not Effective,"Hypothyroidism was already causing me to gain weight, this garbage accelerated the weight gain.  I eat one fish fillet or chicken breast/day, nothing else, now gaining 3-6 lbs./month!  Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online, from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.  Shame on physicians who treat lab results rather than the patient.  I don't care what the numbers are, I still feel awful!"
doxycycline,Effective,"I have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. I had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). I was told I was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. So I was warned to take all of these or I'd be back later for IV treatment and it would be a far longer course. Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects. There was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what I standardly use -- yogurt. I'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement."

asacol,Not Effective,There were no benefits as he had to stop taking it

effexor-xr,Effective,"Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over."

amoxil,Not Effective,"slight reduction but that is all, 2nd week always still there so yet again more pills but usually never completely gone. accupuncture far more effective, within a few weeks gone down, consider that lymph was size of a walnut so that is great news"
panixine-disperdose,Effective,Treatment of skin infection.
buspar,Effective,"As a former drug addict, I flat refused anything that would be addictive. ie diazepam, tamazepam, etc. My doctor suggested buspar as it was not addictive, and yet had similar effects to diazepam. He prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. However, within 20 minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. Anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me. One dose lasted about 5 hours, and did not inhibit any other aspect of my day to day activites. It also helped with my disrupted sleep patterns."
fosamax,Effective,yes - increased bone mass 4% over 2 years. sonagram taken twice in two years this is a very effective drug and i was happy with this experience
ativan,Effective,"It helped relieve anxiety because it made me sleep.  I found that prior to taking this medication, I could not sleep and that I was not eating properly.  My overall health was suffering."
mevacor,Not Effective,"I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors."
seroquel,Not Effective,"As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia"

headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

flonase,Effective,"This spray clears the nasal passages to promote free breathing. I've tried over the counter remedies but they are harsh and you end up practically addicted to them. This works much the same way but is non-addictive and need only be used when symptoms hit. I have used this same product when I've had a head cold and achieved the same results.

The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me."

(I had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms.

I keep it off until I turned 43.  You have to exercise or this will not work. I am not a fan of exercising but when you get the burst of energy get up and move. If you are stuck behind a desk.. turn from side to side... do stretches.. then at lunch or break move!!! There are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. Exercise is the magical word.
So get up and move it. walk.. dance.. or you will be stuck at the same weight. It takes work.. and a lot of it. It amazes me how there are those expecting a miracle in a pill. Not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal"

However, just reading about other people's anxiety accounts and Xanax has given me anxiety!"
omnitrope,Not Effective,skin seems to be producing more collagen and DEFINITELY has better texture and appearance. The low dose of HGH is something that needs to be considered as it really border a theraputic level. The bad side is the cost...500 per month at 1 cc per day. For men I cant tell you how happy I am with the low dose testosterone / Nandrolone (Deca) combination ( 100 mg per week). And generally speaking isnsurance companies DO cover injectable testosterone.

percocet,Effective,The pill was very effective and i felt the relief from the pain considerably right after taking the pill
xanax,Effective,"Reduces anxiety/worry. Really relaxes me and makes me feel much better and lets me sleep. I had major trouble falling asleep before taking this drug. Now I sleep like a baby. Very effective. Taken as prescribed there are no problems. A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great. I take the .5 mg fast acting version, not the long acting version. This way it clears my system quicker and I can take it as needed and not worry about tolerance."
topamax,Effective,"I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome."

seroquel,Effective,Mood was more stable. Better quality of sleep.
lamisil,Not Effective,I received no benefit from the medication.  My prescribing physician told me it would take a full six months of this medication taken daily for it to be effective.  That's not going to work for me.
chantix,Effective,I feel that Chantix is the best way to quit smoking. It was prescribed my my doctor. I smoked for 30 years. The only time I quit during that 30 years was when I was pregnant. I always started back up within a year. This time I know I won't start smoking again.
xanax,Effective,It help me get through the day with out a fast heartbeat. It calmed my nerves.

differin,Effective,Dramatic reduction in papules and pustules.
sonata,Effective,"I was able to go back to sleep after waking and then to get up in two hours without any grogginess or after effects. The sleep I had as a result of the pill was very restful. This drug allows you to take a pill in the early morning hours, go back to sleep and then get up at the normal time without any sort of hangover. It is wonderful."

ortho-tri-cyclen,Effective,"The treatment benefits were clearly protection from getting pregnant as long as the pill is taken regularly without skipping. This pill is also touted as being one that helps in the treatment of acne, although I honestly can't say that it changed my acne pattern whatsoever.

prozac,Effective,"I have taken this drug off and on for 20 years. It is so effective for my depression that I start feeling like I'm ""cured"" and don't need to take it any more. I have found that when I stop taking it, I'll be fine for a few days or weeks, and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years, I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day, because that's not its purpose, however it does keep me from entering a depressive state."
amoxil,Effective,"sore throat went away, cough cleared up; maybe it would have anyway, but at the time it seemed wisest to avoid getting a worse lung infection than letting it heal itself."
prozac,Effective,"this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all."
voltaren,Effective,My knee and leg pains lessened considerably after taking Voltaren orally
spironolactone,Effective,Reduced acne significantly and quickly.  I had severe cystic acne for about 3-4 months before trying spiro.  Within 2 months it was nearly gone.

wellbutrin,Effective,"freedom from depression, in addition, a greater interest in  sex"
retin-a,Not Effective,"After using the Retin A for several months I did notice a decrease in the amount of whiteheads on my checks. My skin seemed to appear brighter and my complexion was not as splotchy. While I did not get any more whiteheads, it did not completely remove the ones I had."
byetta,Not Effective,"I initially had severe cramping and nausea, but I continued under doctor's orders, I only lost about 20 pounds, tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years."
zovirax,Effective,"I have been plagued with peristent mutiple warts on my elbow for over 10 years. At Christmas - I decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the Summer. I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin."

advair-diskus,Not Effective,"Advair helped with my asthma initially, which was agrivated by an upper resperitory virus."
wellbutrin,Not Effective,I didn't feel that there were any benefits. I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor.
prozac,Not Effective,"I felt better mood, optimism towards life in general, greater control of portion sizes. My recovery from anorexia was not easy, so I had a few months of moderate bulimia. It was then that my dosage grew bigger: 3 pills of 20 mg per day, though some days I would have 4 pills."
ortho-tri-cyclen,Effective,Of all of the birthcontrol pills I've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.
retin-a,Effective,My acne scars continued to get better and better and eventually completely disappeared.
protonix,Effective,"Within two days, the severe burning pain of the GERD disappeared. At three months of treatment, the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer, however, I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy."

premarin,Effective,"I did not have to go through the change of life so early in my life, never really felt any change, at the time it was the best way to remove all the endrometriosis that i had, and it never effected me much as in pain or my womenhood."
lamictal,Effective,"According to my psychiatrist and to what I had read, lamictal could be very helpful for people with PTSD. I had tried dozens of meds over the years and, at the time, was totally crippled with anxiety despite being on all the other meds. listed above. Hours after starting Lamictal I was given relief and the anxiety and dissociative symptoms reduced markedly."

armour-thyroid,Effective,"Within about 2 days I noticed I had more energy.  I wasn't waking up tired, I wasn't craving sugar and coffee and my mood improved dramatically.  I stayed on the medication for about 2 years.  Gradually I noticed that I didn't need as much so I cut back on my dose. Eventually I went off for a year or two.  Then when I noticed the old symptoms of mild depression, tiredness, sugar cravings etc., I went back on.  I found that the natural form of Armour allowed my thyroid to kickstart.  After talking to many people who have used the synthetic form, they didn't experience this.  Their thyroid seemed to shut down and they had to always take the drug."
seroquel,Effective,This drug knocked me out i did not wake during the night nor did I remember any dreams. It was difficult to get up in the morning.. This drug is an effective sleep aid but with recent concerns i think there are better choices...

ultram,Effective,The pain from the muscle spasms was drastically reduced.
provigil,Effective,"Immediately made me feel more focus, clear mind, energy, increase calmness. I started with 100mg once a day before work or in the morning on my days off and reduced to 50mg and still have all those benefits. Experienced little nausea, urine odor at the beginning. I don't feel like drinking alcohol anymore and if I drink too much, my hangovers are moderate. Very happy with it!"
zyrtec,Effective,reduced hives associated with allergy. Lasted for 24 hours so did not need more than once a day. Was the only effective treatment. Doctor had switched to generic brand which did not work as effectivly. Available as otc now but I do not feel it is the same as the perscription strength was
humira,Not Effective,Seemed to quiet the disease down especially during the first year.  Colonoscopy showed most of the colon healed after that time.  Fistulas no longer occurred and stayed healed and erythema on legs did not recur once I started taking this.
albuterol,Effective,"Having had asthma since I was a child, I have been using various medications for a long time. Thankfully I do not need to use albuterol daily, as I know some people do, but I use it as needed when I am experiencing an asthma attach. This happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.

As far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. I'm sure it has saved lives. With one inhalation I am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if I am having a bad attack, and am really strugling. So it is very effective"
dispermox,Effective,"I had an infected jaw, an abcess under a back molar that inflamed the entire left side of my lower jaw producing a large ping pong ball sized swelling. This was probably -- my dentist suggested -- due to an infected tooth root that had migrated to jaw tissue.

renova,Not Effective,Not sure at this point.
lyrica,Effective,"Lyrica has made a huge difference with my fibromyalgia pain. I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication, along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure, but I have improved probably 75% over this last year."
mirtazapine,Not Effective,"6hrs sleep per night. Vivid dreams. No other side effects exceptr morning anxity ++. Food tasted better at first, but this faded in a week. To sleep was good, but morning psychedelic effect no good. I sincerely doubt that the mirt would have been manageable without adjunctive benzodiazapine therapy and i wonder if the overall treatment out come would not have been better with benzo monotherapy as i presented with anxiety and insomnia and the M caused anxiety."
accutane,Effective,"My oily skin vanished. The skin cleared up finally. the painful cysts went away for 4 yrs during each treatment. However they will come back (for me anyways) after 4 yrs with stress, mentral cycle, I get them on my jaw line even if i just hold a alcohol swabbed cell phone...Its from mechanical pressure.

acyclovir,Effective,The acyclovir was highly effective even though taken late - ie a week or more after I first got shingles.  It was still spreading 7-10 days later but once I starteed taking this medicine it did clear up.  I was also relieved that I had very little lasting nerve pain afterwards
chantix,Effective,I was able to quit smoking after 7 days without major withdrawals.
levaquin,Effective,"The sinus infections start lightening up within one day, the pressure disappeared within two days If the antibiotics were not prescribed in a timely matter, the infection would have lasted for month.

desyrel,Effective,The medication took all my simptoms away completely!
oxycodone-and-acetaminophen,Not Effective,"IT WORKED FOR RELIEVING SOME OF MY NECK AND BACK PAIN.  PLEASE NOTE, MY CAUSE OF PAIN WAS DUE TO SURGERY PAIN AND NOT YOUR NORMAL KIND OF BACK PAIN.  I MUST SAY THAT IT JUST KIND OF TOOK THE EDGE OFF OF THE SEVERE PAIN I WAS FEELING.
AS TIME WENT ON I BEGAN TO HEAL AND FEEL MUCH BETTER AND NOW IT TENDS TO WORK MUCH BETTER."
celebrex,Not Effective,anti-inflammatory and pain reduction claims.  I didn't notice much difference in the pain but the inflammation went down after a few weeks (not while taking the medication).
doxycycline,Not Effective,"The drug relieved the sore throat and lungs, albeit within two or three days.  I continued to have coughing fits only at night."

amoxil,Effective,"cleared up cough and chest infection, although the treatment worked it was difficult at first to decide how much better it was making me as I had hot flushes, dizziness and diarroheah, all in all it took a good 5 days to start working"
augmentin,Effective,"It truly cleared my headache in three days. I felt no reason to finish the meds unless it was necessary. That pretty much sums it up as to say I would recommend it to others in need. I thank the drug and pharmecutical industry much indeed. Again, Thank you."
lexapro,Effective,"Immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. Also, I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming Lexapro, I experienced results in 2-3 days."
effexor,Effective,"I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference."
prednisone,Effective,"I was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic I was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  The prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost."
lipitor,Effective,"i was told that i have high cholestrol and was very concerned about it so my doctor prescribed Lipitor.

spironolactone,Not Effective,"This drug works great for water retention because it is a potassium-sparing diuretic.  However, it had only a moderate impact on acne.

byetta,Effective,Lowered HbA1C from 6.0 to 5.2 which has enabled me to go off numerous other anti diabetic medications which all had side effects.  The overall effect has been most agreeable including a loss of over 100 pounds of body fat.

Her kidney infection is very rare and i cant remember the name of it but it stars with a P."
neurontin,Effective,"This has enabled me to take half the amount of hydrocodone that I used to take.  The gabapentin potentiates the hydrocodone wonderfully.  It allows me to sleep better also.

I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further."
lexapro,Effective,"I have no more panic attacks, it helped to reduce anxiety, to improve the mood. I feel the old myself again and can function well at work.Sometimes I still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. I highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs."
lexapro,Effective,"Before taking Lexapro, I had constant anxiety.  I wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but I was having them one in awhile.  My anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  I was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  Once I started taking Lexapro, that all changed.  It did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms I experience now.  I am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  I know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success."

clobex,Effective,"This is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  My outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to 9 at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. With a shot of cortizone every couple of years, Clobex takes care of the rest.  When I do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if I treat them right away, I only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. I should mention that I need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks."

aldara,Not Effective,to help heal several facial scar revision surgical wounds to heal faster.
seroquel,Effective,"I am using this on an as needed basis. I only take it a couple times a month, which is why 50mg still works for me.  I may have to go to 100mg though. If I have been up for 20-25 hours straight and if I am still ""bouncing off the walls"" (manic), then this is great stuff to have.
For as needed manic episodes and severe insomnia--this is great stuff."
zomig,Effective,"I would sell my soul to the devil to obtain this miracle pill.  In a little as 30 minutes the intense pain and nausea are gone after one zomig.  I have had migraines since in my early teens where I was unable to function for as long as 48 hrs.  I have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  Zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that I had missed.

zocor,Effective,On Zocor my total cholesterol was lowered below 200 and my LDL was lowered below 100. I currently take Zocor 40mg and could probably reduce the amount I take to 20mg if I would dedicate myself to a serious diet and exercise program. I am a nurse and work nights so this is difficult. Zocor has kept my cholesterol down and reduced my risk for cardiovascular problems.
zyban,Effective,"The treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness', lack of focus, fatigue and irrational mood swings that I had experienced on every other non-Zyban supported attempt to quit smoking.

humira,Effective,The joint pain becomes considerably less within 24 hours of the shot.  I have more energy and almost no more nausea.
accolate,Not Effective,"The benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem I was experiencing.

I noticed that when I was 45 the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  My gastroenterologist prescribed Nexium, which I took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. Then the other symptoms above emerged. When I started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and I rarely ever have stomach problems now."

ritalin,Effective,"allowed me to focus on the tasks at hand, run a business and get things accomplished"
lunesta,Effective,"I have trouble sleeping -- I usually toss and turn all night, sleep a couple of hours and wake up.  Normally, I never get a complete night's rest.

It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it. I feel like I am not overly leveled out and blah like I felt with Depakote, more like I avoid the worst and can be in control."
retin-a,Effective,"Regular use of Retin A cleared my acne dramatically. Initially, I experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. This lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. Within about six weeks, I would guess my skin was 75% clearer. Over the past twelve years, I have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse."

effexor-xr,Effective,"Alleviated my despair, gave me back some control of my emotions and motivated me to work harder at managing my depression and get out of the house."

I've increased to 100mg 2x's a day.  I've lost approximately 25 pounds but I think that's because of an interaction from the Concerta & Lamotrigine."
motrin,Effective,"loss of stiffness and more mobility.  After a heavy weight workout, taking Miotrin relieved the stiffness and iflamation around lower back.  Next day mobility and flesibility was much greater, and less pain."

ventolin-hfa,Effective,I have had asthma for years and take albuterol.  I heard about this new inhaler from a physician at work. He stated that it was a more pure form of the drug.  At the time he stated it was expensive to get. At the same time we were finding out that albuterol was being discontinued.  The replacement had a horrible taste to it. My son who has severe asthma was even refusing to take the new inhalor. I asked my physician for it specifically at my next visit. He did not hesitate to provide me the prescription.  My insurance company doesn't pay much of anything so I worried they would not cover it and they did.  I was very happy that it worked so well with no funny taste.

diazepam,Not Effective,"I found that I actually felt worse rather than better, the only benefit was that with  imovane I could sleep at night which I couldn't do earlier. I never really felt rested though. I am not sure if the combination of these 3 drugs caused my anxiety to become worse. Venlafaxine was supposed to help my depression but I found it totally ineffective. I am wondering if I get a higher dose will it help but I am afraid it might make it worse . WOuld love to go off all of these medicines as I feel the side effects are worse than the depression"
imitrex,Effective,"I had my first migraine at age 10 and suffered for almost 60 years. Then Imitrex--a miracle!  Imitrex, finally, gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress, I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A ""generic"" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory,  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?"
nuvaring,Effective,"Did not get pregnant, regular periods."
retin-a,Not Effective,"Occasionally, acne would subside slightly."
asacol,Effective,I have found the product to be the only thing to work for autoimune Ulcerative Cholitis.    I was diagnosed with UC at age 43 after extensive testing.   Tried several other products and supplements to keep UC in remission but none have been effective.  The price is very expensive and is out of the reach of those without insurance cost is in the price range of $900 per months.   The company that makes the drug does offer programs for the non insured to receive at very substantial discounts or at no cost

spironolactone,Effective,I am 28 and had acne like a 16 year old the day before the prom. It was horrible and embarrassing. This was an experiment. We had no idea if it would even work. We started at 50mg twice daily and then went to the 100mg when there were no results. My face is flawless now. I am also sleeping better which I don't think is a coincidence.
sarafem,Not Effective,"It kept me at a low-functioning level (work and occassional activities), which was an improvement for me.  It kept me functioning due to decreased depression.  I had taken it for a few years on and off before finally switching to another drug two days ago due to the drug becomming no longer effective.  When I was younger and the drug was new to me it was much more effective."
nuvigil,Effective,Benefits were I was able to stay awake during the day. And now that I have esophageal cancer I strongly believe Nuvigil is a big help with the side effects of chemoradiation treatments.

tramadol,Not Effective,Some reduction of pain
xanax,Effective,"I had severe anxiety attacks and once they would start it was very difficult to decrease their intensity.  My heart beat got as high as 160bpm on two occasions.

zofran,Effective,cured the hyperemesis I was suffering completely with no noticeable side effects.
meridia,Effective,"Meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also, it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body!"

After taking Niaspan for a few weeks, my lpa was within normal limits."
protonix,Not Effective,"Reduced excess acid and throat irritation, although not completely. Bending over still causes bile in throat.  Nighttime coughing still happens.

maxalt,Effective,"Maxalt relieved all the typical symptoms of a migraine within half an hour and i could keep going with my day where as before nothing would help.

toprol-xl,Not Effective,"It seems to keep my blood pressure and headaches in check, especially during hormonal changes right before my period begins.  I am also sleeping better at night (falling asleep and staying asleep; able to get back to sleep during the night), whereas before I was getting only a couple of hours of sleep a night."
locoid-lipocream,Not Effective,"Unfortunately this did nothing to heal the skin. It was an expensive experiment for the doctor to misdiagnose my condition, which was not sever but had been present for 9+ months. Eventually I was switched to fluocinonide, which seemed to do only a little better."

Prior to taking singular, exposure to a home with dogs caused symptoms similar to flu..achiness, rhinitis, sneezing and runny nose.  After singular...symptom free.  My doctor advised that there is no risk in taking the medication long term, so I plan to continue its prophylactic effect."

The skin became thinner in appearance and more and more dry. It seemed to be harming my skin. At that point my dermotologist said my skin may be too sensitive. I do not feel that I have sensitive skin because while I may have a pale color skin, it has a olive tone. I do not sunburn very easily. Then I switched to ROC but had similar results."
nuvaring,Effective,"First of all- no babies! So it's effective. It also slowed my periods a lot, i had heavy bleeding and severe cramping before, and now I have a 4 day period with cramping usually only on the first day.

After trying it, I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares.

I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better."

I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.

I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.

Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real.

Not only did I feel sluggish, but my liver was even slow to act because I started turning orange! My fingertips were calloused, my speech was slurred and my hair had begun falling out.  When the first dosage was given, it was too high.  Then when it was adjusted and my blood levels determined that it was the right amount, the symptoms all began to subside and slowly I became functional again.  I don't normally take any over-the-counter medications but as for this prescription medication, I need it to effectively manage my hypothyroidism."

protonix,Effective,Effective in helping to control acid reflux
betaseron,Effective,"Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for."
nortriptyline,Not Effective,"very little benefit, slept a bit better, still got anxiety, cant always sleep, offered valium as well for bad days, good days are wonderful, stressful time isnt over yet so body still goes into panic"

My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before."
tamiflu,Effective,"I took Tamiflu as soon as I knew I had contracted Swine Flu.  While it did not stop the flu in its tracks I did not get seriously ill and my recovery time was quite short.  Somo of my friends also contracted Swine Flu and did not take Tamiflu.  Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.

citalopram,Not Effective,"None. When I was last encountering depression 10 years ago, my Doctor gave me some round green pills whose name I can't rememeber.

lamictal,Not Effective,"Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). The mood difference is noticeable. My pscychiatrist prescribed Lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, Lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice."
synthroid,Not Effective,"none, I was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. I had no energy."

I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression.

The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.

The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics."
fosamax,Not Effective,"none whatsoever as i was only on it for 6 months . I had no nhealth problems prior to taking this drug to help my bone density, it nonly created havoc with my previous good health."

dilantin,Effective,"Dilantin provided Control of seizures
(mostly petits) as these were more frequent.
Generally, the drug is still as effective as when
first introduced to me so there has

It was imperative in my treatment, though, that the drug be NON GENERIC ONLY."
wellbutrin-xl,Effective,"Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like."

The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia, as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program, using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication, thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However, the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help."

lac-hydrin,Not Effective,"It was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines."

retin-a-micro,Effective,"I started using Retin-A after the birth of my second child when I broke out with
adult acne.  At the time it was not advertised as an anti aging cream and as I was only 26 or so I really wasn't concerned about wrinkles. Because of the warning of photosensitivity increase to sun exposure I used sunscreen daily (I lived in Tampa,FL). Now at the age of 62 I have gorgeous skin. Yes, I LOVE products but my basic regimen has not changed. Cleansing,Sunscreen and Retinol-A
at bedtime. I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation."

I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work."
propecia,Not Effective,"Hair loss almost stopped, although minor loss continued."
percocet,Effective,"Due to unresponsiveness to acetaminophen and negative side effects from aspirin and ibuprofen, I was given a prescription to Percocet.  This did a wonderful job reliving the pain.  I now live a pain free life."

valium,Effective,"After intolerable side effects of an anti depressant it relaxed my stomach (stopped vomiting) relaxed muscles so constant shaking and shivering subsided,helped me sleep and for me to actually have normal and relaxed thoughts.

flexeril,Not Effective,Not sure if it is effective or not.  Pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  I am virtually unable to function by evening.  I think I may ask my physician to prescribe an additional 5mg to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon.
lidocaine,Effective,"Almost immediate (i.e. within 15 minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. These patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  I have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  Chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. I use them only as a last resort."
prednisone,Effective,I went from being in extreme pain and sometimes almost immobile to being able to go back to work at a physical job
depo-provera,Effective,"I was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (No children, yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus, I no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms, either.  I can not complain about this drug at all."
triaz,Effective,My acne has been greatly reduced and my skin is a lot clearer. I also found that my skin is less oily. I saw these results within the first month of using the product.

propecia,Not Effective,There were no benefits that I could perceive.  The hairloss continued but worst of all the side-effects from this drug are severe and permanent.  This is very disturbing!
prednisone,Effective,I never really had any complications with my disease. It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time.
effexor,Not Effective,"less anxiety, emotional stability"

    * Having seasonal allergies, such as hay fever
    * Frequently exposing your skin to water or other wet substances"

celebrex,Effective,"I feel like a new person. I've had an MRI and all sorts of other tests and no one can find anything wrong with my right hip. I believe I tore the hip flexor several years ago in a yoga class and it never healed properly. Sitting at a desk for work aggravates the pain, and I bike every day which isn't good for it either.

After Klonopin made me sleepy, I asked for the only other bz he was willing to prescribe,(Ativan),and w/in one week was going through massive w/drawals from the lack of potency of the drug.

I have tried almost every treatment out there, and no results have compared to those I got from using Accutane.  Take it from someone who's suffered a long time: try it and you won't be sorry.  Be wary of some of the possible side effects, though.  I didn't experience anything too drastic, but everyone's different."

bystolic,Effective,"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded."

I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!"

Methadone has allowed me to get my ""bearings"" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task."

accutane,Effective,"Almost complete removal of all existing and future acne. I took this drug with meals and could not be happier.

I took that in combination with the clonazepam"
estrace,Effective,"reduction of hot flashes, and reduction of vaginal dryness. I'd already been trying a vaginal estrogen ring, but this wasn't enough of a dose for me, apparently.

neurontin,Effective,"Helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.

tramadol,Not Effective,I had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep.

differin,Not Effective,"There were little to no benefits to using differin to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differin, using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately, it did not."
neoprofen,Effective,THE BEST painkillers ever! Quite low dosage when it comes to the active substance used but it does work perfect.

wellbutrin,Effective,"The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money."
inderal,Effective,"The major benefit of taking this medication was a decrease in the signs and symptoms of anxiety that I experience when in social situations. It prevents the elevation in heart rate that I normally get, as well as preventing dry mouth, sweaty palms, etc. As a result, I am much more able to focus on the task at hand."
prednisone,Effective,"the reduction in inflammation was so great that there was an overall systemic improvement of
edema resulting from a deeply toxic experience of mold exposure that disrupted my entire

protonix,Effective,"I was told to avoid coffee, tea, chocolate & peppermint :'(  My hiatal hernia is tiny, but I feel fortunate that I was told about it before it got out of hand.  I feel 100% better 90% of the time, and when I don't, it's usually because I forgot to take my pill the previous day.  I would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone, but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.  It's my goal to control my pain naturally, wish me luck!"

Highly effective."
vicodin,Effective,The treatment results were successful.  The prescription took the pain away.

Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes."

My mother is stunned. She says this is the first time she's ever been able to ask me where things are in my apartment and have me know (and be right). I take a medication holiday from Vyvanse most weekends and actual work holidays when I don't need to be able to concentrate."

Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant.
lortab,Effective,"As having surgery, my mounth experienced excruiating pain. I was without them for 3 hours. These seemed like the worst day of my life. After taking the pills I noticed one of two things occured. One, the pain was gone soon after taking them. Two, I became extremely tired. First I thought that it was only like this because I just had surgery, but no. It seemed as though everytime I taken a pill I needed a nap soon after. Don't get me wrong, I would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. This stayed this way for the entire time that I was on Lortab."

voltaren,Not Effective,Hardly any- it was much less effective than paracetamol against the pain. I still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. I hoped taking Voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective.
byetta,Effective,This  slows the sugar going into my system so that my body can use most of my own insulin to process the sugar.  It is to be taken along with the metformin. It has helped control my blood sugar very well.

ortho-tri-cyclen,Effective,"no pregnancy, reduced ance"
acyclovir,Effective,drug was prescribed for off label use to treat recurrent infections by physician whose protocol addresses high viral load in limbic system (chicken pox) and GI tract (MMR vaccine remnants).  It seemed to work - could be that other environmental variables were removed simultaneously but I can't think of variables that were exactly concurrent with taking of this drug.  It stopped 6 week recurrent symptoms of cold/flu-like exhaustion.
zomig,Effective,"Before when I had a migraine headache I used to be in agony for at least 48 hours. I would have to go to bed because the pain was so bad.

desyrel,Effective,"I can not shut my mind down to go to sleep.  I will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot ""shut down."" I originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage, depending on how ""excitable"" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone."
valium,Effective,"The immediate benefits were the relaxing, pain free life I am now experiencing. I am not sure how long it will last, but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years, and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination, I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake, I am hurting, but within 20 minutes of taking meds, I am my old, 25 year old self again."
diovan,Effective,For over a period of several years my blood pressure has gone down and has stayed down. Follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked.

I am mistaken for being younger than my age, however, whether it's heredity or product, I'll never know for sure."
minocin,Effective,"I have been struggling with adult acne. A dermatologist prescribes the Minocycline and for the first two months, it worked great. I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60, wigs are definitely in order. Also, I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased."

retin-a,Not Effective,"The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however."
ativan,Effective,"ALL my anxiety, stress, were gone. I also have Tourette's Syndrome, which is a neurological disorder which causes me to have involentary movements and sounds that I have no controll over, (tics.) And once I started taking this medicine, the tics were such at the minimum, i used to have 50-100 tics a day, now i have 3-4 tics all because of Lorazepam. This might be a very good treatment for others with Tourette's Syndrome!!"
protonix,Effective,effective in helplng to control acid reflux
lamisil,Effective,I just finished my 90 day course and am seeing great benefits.  My toenails are finally growing out thin and clear.  I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year.

I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking, large social gatherings, dates, and other anxiety provoking situations.

tirosint,Effective,"I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower."

maxalt,Effective,"This is the best migraine medication on the market. Imitrex no longer works for me. I cannot be without maxalt or I will be in the ER.

But, with Maxalt, I take one dose and it lasts for the whole migraine and I never have to take another dose until the next migraine."

In fact, I found myself able to do things that before I wasn't able of doing, like having conversations with irritating family members."
tenormin,Effective,"The benefits were immediate relief from a ""racing heart"" or tachycardia caused by anxiety. I use this medicine prophylactically and found that it is very effective in controlling my heart rate and keeping it within a normal range.

I took the anti anxiety drug for 2 years and its side effect that it blocks nerve communication helped a lot, and thx god after 5 years i am cured, my nerve healed."
zovirax,Effective,I have had Herpes Zoster or VZV all my life. Acyclovir completely eliminates the headache and flu like symptoms. If I take it early enough it stops all outbreaks in one or two days. If taken late; I need a higher dose and it can eliminate blisters in 2 or three days. My outbreaks were once or twice a year and I only used acyclovir cream.

valtrex,Not Effective,Shortened duration of herpes outbreak.
cymbalta,Not Effective,Slight anxiety reduction but minimal.
prednisone,Not Effective,"Facial swelling reduced dramatically over 3 days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.  Since then I've learned that some physicians are quite blas? about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about ""first do no wrong"" is no longer important."
provigil,Effective,"I am able to stay awake while driving.  I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.

retin-a,Not Effective,"The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been.

celexa,Effective,"Citalopram turned me into myself again. I didn't really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. I have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. I wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. I feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. I have also experienced some weight loss while on Citalopram, probably because I feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! Additionally I've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly."
sotret,Effective,the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit.

nasarel,Effective,"Prior to using this spray, I had year round nasal problems: unable to breathe out of one or both nostrils.

lexapro,Effective,benefits: Nervous twitch went away under my eye. I am able to handle stressful situations better.
triphasil,Effective,"general medical benefits:  contraception, hormone management.  Personal benefits: i controlled my weight better, skin looked more radiant and menstruation pains were alot less than when i was not on the medication.

levoxyl,Effective,"I had developed panic attacks and depression. I had other symptoms such as small weight gain, hair thinning, very tired and slept allot.  The doctor originally thought that I simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  After about a year things still were not right.  So she did a thyroid panel.

I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.
vagifem,Effective,"Before the use of vagifem tablets, I had to endure a series of urinary infections after sometimes painful sexual intercourse.  I also had painful cracks in mucoal lining of vulva due to aging and dryness.  After beginning the use of this drug, I found that the ncreased mucous in vagina resolved both of these problems."

I have started back on .625 and plan to take it for 10 more years. My mother in law has been on it for 35 years and looks and feels much younger than her 76 years. I have no risk factors, so I decided it is right for me"
cymbalta,Effective,after taking 30mg for 4 days i realized in the middle of the night that i no longer had any pain any where in my body. before my whole body hurt. i'm thinking i must have had fibromyalgia. i still have no pain and therefore am able to move about more easily. i'm hoping this will last. i can't remember a time in my life when i had no pain. i also noticed that my hot flashes have all but deminished.

I use the generic tablets, cause they are a little cheaper with my insurance"

lyrica,Not Effective,Perhaps a slight improvement in nerve pain
prevacid,Not Effective,It is difficult to discern if there were any real treatment benefits.  Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification.

avelox,Not Effective,None. made me sick to my stomach.
ultram,Not Effective,"The Tramadol helped minimally at first.  I did stop working for the pain.  I've continued to take it because it helped dramatically for the fatigue, without any jitters.  I honestly could not get out of bed in the morning if it weren't for this drug."

effexor,Not Effective,"After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences."
ativan,Effective,"Calm me down, helped me sleep, did not wake up a lot during the night, able to handle stressfull situations.  This has be great taking at this time in my life, my dad died three years ago, my brother passed in October of 09 and my mom just moved in with me.

nasacort-aq,Effective,"Nasacort AQ has proven to be extremely effective in controlling my nasal stuffiness and sinusitis related to allergies.  Before use, it seemed my nose/sinuses were clogged on & off and made me much more susceptible to colds/flu--as much as 4 to 5 times per year & lasting 10 days to 2 weeks each round.  I was miserable.  Nasacort keeps my nasal passages open--it's a wonder!!"
prednisone,Effective,Took care of the GCA -as long as I am taking it at least.
singulair,Effective,"Singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  If I forget to take it, I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact, I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair."
prilosec,Effective,"It completely eliminated all heartburn symptoms.  I am able to eat what I want whenever I want.  This is after nearly 2 years (before going on the drug) of trying to change my diet and lifestyle but no matter what I did, I could not find relief of constant, daily heartburn.  My days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. This drug finally gave me relief."
propecia,Effective,It stopped my hair loss!!!! I have regrew some hair too!!! It works dudes try it! Stick with it cuz its worth it. Propecia is a dream come true.

I was worried about side affects at first but had none. Ive had a great experience and want to share it with you. I wish i started treatment earlier. My only advise is to do it now!!!!!

vasotec,Effective,"i had elevated blood pressure which was treated with different medications in the past. initially i was treated with norvasc which caused constipation. then i was treated with cozaar which did not control blood pressure well , instead it caused fluctuation of the blood pressure going from high to low over the course of the day, which made me very uncomfortable because i will sense both high and low blood pressure and have headache whether it was low or high. vasotec even in the small dose that i am taking now   normalized  my blood pressure , so i do not have  fluctuation of the  blood pressure any more."
flonase,Effective,"Not only was my nose cleared up almost immediately, my allergies weren't as harsh.  my Step father is a MD and he prescribes this to all of his patients.  I love this stuff.  The only bad part was that for the first minute or so after spraying it everything smelled very bad."

retin-a,Not Effective,"Reduced acne.  I had mild/moderate acne, and Retin-A did decrease the amount of ance I had.  I liked Retin-A also because it reduces wrinkles.  I am only 28, so I don't have many wrinkles, but used it as prevention."
chantix,Not Effective,The only time I didn't want to smoke was when I was so nauseous and or throwing up after taking the medication. I seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication.

doxycycline,Not Effective,I didn't feel that it was beneficial but the cough and yellow phelgm production lead me believe my bronchitis was bacterial therefore i had my doctor prescribe an antibiotic.  the one would not have been my choice for a respiratory issue.
prempro,Effective,"I started to take Prempro, the lowest dose, at age 56, because I would have freak periods - every six months.  I never really went through menopause.  No hot flashes, no night sweats.  But just a period out of the blue.  My doctor put me on 1 pill/day, .3, 1.5, and then I started to decrease the dose slowly to 1/2 pill per day, then 1/3 pill/day, then 1/4 pill/day.  Now I take one pill/week.  I find that the Prempro keeps my skin smooth and prevents incontinence, which started to happen when I tried to quit the drug entirely.
I still take it, but I do have water retention, even with this small dose."
zyrtec,Effective,"The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition. It did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what I expected (I took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation)."
tramadol,Not Effective,"In order to get any effects, I had to take 4-5 times the prescribed dosage.  The medication is simply VERY WEAK.  This drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level."

climara,Not Effective,---
micardis,Not Effective,The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.
